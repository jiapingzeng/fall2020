      \item [5.6]
            \textbf{Answer}:
      \item [P5] Suppose you are given an array of sorted integers that has been circularly shifted $k$ positions to the right. For example, taking $1,3,4,5,7$ and circularly shifting it $2$ positions to the right you get $5,7,1,3,4$. Design an efficient algorithm for finding $k$.\\
            \textbf{Answer}:
      \item [P6] Consider $d$ sorted array of integers each containing $n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d$ numbers. The numbers $n_i$ are arbitrary. The total number of all elements is $n$ (sum of all $n_i$) Design an $O(n\log d)$ algorithm that merges all arrays into one sorted list. You may wish to use a data structure that we have discussed in class.
