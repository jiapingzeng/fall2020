\begin{itemize}
    \item [4.1.2] Which of the following statements about graphs $G$ and $H$ are true? Substantiate your answers!
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [(ii)] $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if there exists a bijection $f:E(G)\rightarrow E(H)$.\\\textbf{False}, by counter example: let $G=(V,E)=(\{1\},\emptyset)$ and $H=(V',E')=(\{1,2\},\emptyset)$; then there exists a bijection $f:E\rightarrow E'$ but $G$ and $H$ are not isomorphic.
        \item [(iii)] If there exists a bijection $f:V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ such that every vertex $u\in V(G)$ has the same degree as $f(u)$, then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.\\\textbf{True}, 
        \item [(iv)] If $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, then there exists a bijection $f:V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ such that every vertex $u\in V(G)$ has the same degree as $f(u)$, then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.
        \item [(v)] If $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, then there exists a bijection $f:E(G)\rightarrow E(H)$.\\\textbf{True}; since $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, by definition, there exists a bijection $f:V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ such that $\{x,y\}\in E(G)\Leftrightarrow\{f(x),f(y)\}\in E(H)$ for distinct $x,y\in V(G)$. 
        \item [(vi)] $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if there exists a map $f:V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ such that for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, we have $\{u,v\}\in E(G)\Leftrightarrow\{f(u),f(v)\}\in E(H)$.
        \item [(vii)] Every graph on $n$ vertices is isomorphic to some graph on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.
        \item [(viii)] Every graph on $n\geq 1$ vertices is isomorphic to infinitely many graphs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item [4.1.4] Show that a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is assymetric if and only if $n!$ distinct graphcs on the set $V(G)$ are isomorphic to $G$.
    \item [4.1.6] How many graphs on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}$ are isomorphic to the graph consisting of $n$ vertex-disjoint edges?
